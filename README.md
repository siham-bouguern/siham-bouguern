I am a Data Analyst / Industrial Manufacturing Engineer. I'm a driven and curious data analyst with experience working with Python, SQL, tableau and others. With a passion for creative innovation and solving complex problems, I am eager to implement my skills further and improve my data analysis experience. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in industrial manufacturing engineering, and I am an experienced marketing associate with three years of experience (since 2020).
